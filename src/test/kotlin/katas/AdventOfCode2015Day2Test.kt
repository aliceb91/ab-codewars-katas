// The elves are running low on wrapping paper.
// They need to submit an order for more.
// They have a list of dimensions (length l, width 2 and height h) of each present.
// They only want to order exactly as much as they need.

// Fortunately, every present is a box.
// This makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier.
// This is because it is equal to the surface area of the box.
// The equation for this is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l.
// The elves also need a little extra paper for each present.
// This is the area of the smallest side.

// All numbers in the elves list are in feet.
// How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
